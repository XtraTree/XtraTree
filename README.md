## About

Enterprise Architect focused on aligning business strategy, operational processes, and IT governance with secure, scalable hybrid infrastructures.

This GitHub profile is a strategic portfolio showcasing architectural frameworks, governance models, and transformation blueprints developed across enterprise environments.

**It is not code-centric. It is architecture-centric.**

### Technology Architecture
- Hybrid & Multi-Cloud Strategy
- Network Modernization (MPLS → SD-WAN)
- Zero-Trust Architecture
- Cloud-Native Security & Resilience

---

## Architecture Domains

### Hybrid & Multi-Cloud
Workload placement models, governance frameworks, regulatory alignment, resilience strategy.

### Network Modernization
Enterprise WAN redesign, segmentation models, modernization governance processes.

### Zero-Trust Security
Identity-centric access models, segmentation strategies, policy enforcement patterns.

### Cloud Governance
Policy-as-code principles, compliance architecture, workload lifecycle governance.

## Portfolio Structure

Each architectural case study follows a structured model:

1. **Business Context**
2. **Current-State Assessment**
3. **Target Architecture Blueprint**
4. **Governance & Control Model**
5. **Process Flow Design**
6. **Risk & Trade-off Analysis**
7. **Reusable Architecture Patterns**

---

## Architectural Philosophy

- Architecture is strategic, not technical documentation
- Governance must be embedded, not layered
- Process discipline enables scalable transformation
- Security is structural, not reactive
- Complexity must be intentionally designed

---

## Professional Focus

- Enterprise Architecture Strategy
- IT Governance Frameworks
- Business Process Integration
- Secure Hybrid & Cloud Architecture
- Transformation Advisory
