# Jonathan Tene — Enterprise Architecture Portfolio

**Designing Secure, Resilient, AI-Ready Hybrid & Multi-Cloud Infrastructures**

<p align="center">
  <em>Real-world architectural evidence from large-scale transformation programs in regulated industries</em>
</p>

<br/>

I am an **Enterprise Architect** specializing in:

- Hybrid & multi-cloud strategies  
- Network modernization & segmentation  
- Zero Trust security & identity-driven access  
- Cloud-native governance & workload hardening  
- Data center optimization & migration  
- Risk-informed decision frameworks

This is **not** a traditional code repository.  
This is an **Architectural Evidence Library**  a collection of sanitized, real-world case studies, decision rationales, patterns, and governance models drawn from complex enterprise transformations in **healthcare**, **finance**, **public sector**, and large distributed organizations.

### What You Will Find Here

- **Hybrid & multi-cloud architecture blueprints** (workload placement, data residency, resilience)  
- **Network modernization patterns** (MPLS → SD-WAN, data center relocation & optimization)  
- **Zero Trust & security posture** implementations (NAC, identity, SecOps, continuous protection)  
- **Cloud-native governance & hardening** patterns (Kubernetes, policy-as-code, compliance alignment)  
- **Migration strategies**, cutover approaches, risk models & operational designs  
- **Architecture decision records (ADRs)** and lessons learned from production environments

Each repository or folder represents **the most recent and relevant consulting engagements** focused on **why** decisions were made, **how** trade-offs were handled, and **what** outcomes were achieved.

### Core Architecture Domains

| Domain                     | Primary Focus areas                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hybrid & Multi-Cloud**   | Data residency, disaster recovery (RTO/RPO), workload placement, repatriation       |
| **Network Modernization**  | SD-WAN, segmentation, data center optimization & relocation, minimal-risk migration |
| **Zero Trust Security**    | Identity as perimeter, NAC/ISE, continuous monitoring & remediation, SecOps         |
| **Cloud-Native Governance**| Workload hardening, policy enforcement, compliance mapping, Kubernetes security    |

### Flagship Repositories & Patterns

- **[00-Architecture Principles](https://github.com/XtraTree/00-Architecture-Principles)**  
  Enterprise Architecture principles for designing secure, resilient, AI-ready hybrid infrastructures across network, cloud, and security domains.

- **[01-Hybrid-Multi-Cloud-Blueprints](https://github.com/XtraTree/01-Hybrid-Multi-Cloud-Blueprints)**  
  Patterns for regulated industries (healthcare & finance), secure workload distribution, data sovereignty, resilience, and zero-trust segmentation across on-premises and multiple clouds

- **[02-Network-Modernization](https://github.com/XtraTree/02-Network-Modernization)**  
  Large-scale MPLS-to-SD-WAN transformations, data center optimization & relocation methodologies, risk-mitigated cutover strategies

- **[03-Zero-Trust-Security](https://github.com/XtraTree/03-Zero-Trust-Security)**  
  Practical application of zero-trust principles using Cisco ISE/NAC, identity driven micro-segmentation, endpoint protection & SecOps practices

- **[04-Cloud-Native-Governance](https://github.com/XtraTree/04-Cloud-Native-Governance)**  
  Cloud agnostic governance models, AKS / Kubernetes hardening, policy enforcement patterns, compliance alignment (CIS, regulatory frameworks)

### Guiding Architecture Principles

All designs and case studies are shaped by these consistent principles:

- **Security & Identity** — Secure by Design, Identity as the new perimeter  
- **Operational Excellence** — Observability-first, Network as Control Plane, Governance embedded early  
- **Architectural Flexibility** — Cloud-agnostic patterns, strong resilience & reliability focus  
- **Future-readiness** — Foundations prepared for AI/ML workloads and data-intensive services

### About Me

Enterprise Architect with **20+ years** of experience evolving complex network & security environments into secure, governable, and cloud-ready platforms.

Most recent focus areas include:

- Hybrid/multi-cloud transformations in regulated sectors  
- SD-WAN & network modernization at scale  
- Zero Trust program implementation  
- Data center consolidation, optimization & relocation  
- Cloud repatriation and hybrid disaster recovery strategies  
- AI-ready infrastructure foundations

### Purpose of This Portfolio

To show how **enterprise architecture is practiced in reality** — beyond slideware, beyond vendor demos, centered on:

- High-quality architectural decisions  
- Risk understanding and mitigation  
- Governance that survives production  
- Trade-off navigation in complex, regulated environments

> “Architecture is not what we deploy.  
> Architecture is **how we decide**.”

<br/>

**Open to interesting challenges in enterprise architecture, hybrid cloud strategy, zero trust transformation, and AI infrastructure foundations.**

Feel free to explore the repositories — feedback and thoughtful questions are always welcome.
