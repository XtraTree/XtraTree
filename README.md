Jonathan Tene — Enterprise Architecture Portfolio
Designing Secure, Resilient, AI-Ready Hybrid Infrastructures

I am an Enterprise Architect specializing in network, security, cloud, and operational governance for large and regulated environments (healthcare, finance, public sector).
This GitHub is not a code repository.
It is an Architectural Evidence Library documenting real-world transformation programs, decision frameworks, and governance models used to design and modernize enterprise infrastructures.

What you will find here
	• Hybrid and multi-cloud architecture blueprints
	• Network modernization patterns (MPLS → SD-WAN, Data Center Optimisation)
	• Zero-Trust security using NAC, identity, and SecOps
	• Cloud-native governance and workload hardening patterns
	• Migration strategies, risk models, and operational design
	• Architecture decision rationale and lessons learned
	
Each repository is a sanitized case study focused on how and why architectural decisions were made.

Core Architecture Domains
Domain	Focus
Hybrid & Multi-Cloud	Data residency, resilience (RTO/RPO), workload placement
Network Modernization	Segmentation, SD-WAN, data center optimization
Zero-Trust Security	Identity-driven access, NAC, continuous protection
Cloud-Native Governance	Workload hardening, policy enforcement, compliance

Flagship Repositories
01 — Hybrid Multi-Cloud Blueprints
Architecture patterns for healthcare and financial institutions distributing workloads across on-prem and cloud while respecting data residency, resilience, and zero-trust segmentation.

02 — Network Modernization
Enterprise transformation from MPLS to SD-WAN and methodology for optimizing and relocating data center infrastructures with minimal risk.

03 — Zero-Trust Security
Applying zero-trust principles using Cisco ISE/NAC and SecOps practices for identity-based segmentation and continuous protection.

04 — Cloud-Native Governance
Cloud-agnostic governance and hardening patterns for multi-cloud and Kubernetes environments aligned with compliance and zero-trust.


Architecture Principles
All case studies are built upon consistent principles:
	• Secure by Design
	• Identity as the new perimeter
	• Network as a control plane
	• Observability and SecOps integration
	• Governance before tooling
	• Cloud-agnostic design
	• AI-ready infrastructure foundations

About Me
Enterprise Architect with 20+ years in network and security engineering, specializing in transforming complex infrastructures into secure, governable, cloud-ready platforms.
Experience across:
	• Healthcare systems
	• Financial institutions
	• Government and public sector
	• Large distributed enterprises

Purpose of this portfolio
To demonstrate how enterprise architecture is practiced in real environments — beyond theory, beyond tooling, focused on decision quality, risk control, and governance.

	“Architecture is not what we deploy. Architecture is how we decide.”
